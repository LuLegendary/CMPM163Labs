    Cube on the top right: Example of part1
    
    Cube on the top left: The cube I made by my own without my own shader(the self-made cube for part one)
    
    Cube on the bottom right: Example of part2 with shader
    
    Cube on the bottom left: The cube I made by my own with my own shader(the self-made cube for part one)(I tried to add my own vertix and fragment file to it, but it doesn't work and always shows gl.getProgramInfoLog No compiled fragment shader when at least one graphics shader is attached. I tried to google it, but no people show the solution. I tried to figure it out but I can't so I basically just write a "addHotCube" function and change the color. I hope I can figure it out in the future.)
